# The Plain v3.0

The Plain is a minimalist Jekyll theme, designed to focus on writing that really matters to you and your audience. Everything else is just a distraction. Nothing more other than useful and understandable information sharing. I have made a final update to this theme. This theme is suit best for personal blog type, but not limited to. P/S: This theme is originally inspired from Leonard Lamprecht's original [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/leo/leo.github.io) (thanks!).
